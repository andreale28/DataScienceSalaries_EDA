# Data Science Salaries EDA Project
In this project, we use the Data Science Job Salaries from Kaggle and perform EDA on it. More detail can be found on the notebook.

**Note**: For this project, I mainly use pandas combining with hvplot + holoviews api to explore the data. Even though, this approach still 
has some drawback which is mainly due to the limitation of hvplot in terms of annotation (displaying value label on chart .etc)
